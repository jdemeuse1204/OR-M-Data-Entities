# OR-M-Data-Entities
Speedy Object Relational Mapper

OR-M Data Entities
Overview:  <br><br>
This solution is a micro Object-Relational Mapper aimed at speed.  Others out there can be bulky and slow, unlike OR-M Data Entities.  OR-M Data Entities is designed to feel like Entity Framework to minimize any learning curve.  In fact, I have gotten a lot of compliments saying that OR-M Data Entities is easier to setup and use.  The reason setup is easier and the OR-M is easier comes from less micro-managing of code.  No tables are created if they are not there, table names are your class names, unless you change them.  Everything is much more straight forward, including the creation of foreign keys. Check it out for yourself!
